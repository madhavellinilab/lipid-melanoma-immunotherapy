# Introduction

Melanoma represents one of the most aggressive forms of skin cancer, with rising global incidence rates and significant mortality burden. While the advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies has revolutionized melanoma treatment, substantial proportions of patients exhibit primary or acquired resistance to these therapies. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying therapeutic resistance and identifying novel biomarkers for patient stratification remain critical unmet needs in melanoma oncology.

Recent advances in cancer metabolism research have illuminated the profound influence of metabolic reprogramming on tumor progression and immune evasion. Lipid metabolism, in particular, has emerged as a crucial regulator of cancer cell survival, proliferation, and resistance to therapy. Tumor cells frequently exhibit aberrant lipid metabolic programs characterized by enhanced fatty acid synthesis, desaturation, and elongation to support rapid membrane biogenesis, energy storage, and signaling molecule production. Key enzymes in de novo lipogenesis, including fatty acid synthase (FASN), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACACA), stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), and sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), are commonly upregulated across diverse cancer types and associated with poor clinical outcomes.

Beyond their intrinsic roles in tumor cell biology, lipid metabolic pathways profoundly influence the tumor microenvironment and anti-tumor immune responses. Accumulating evidence suggests that aberrant tumor lipid metabolism can reshape the immune landscape by modulating immune cell recruitment, differentiation, and function. Lipid-rich tumor microenvironments have been shown to impair cytotoxic T cell activity, promote regulatory T cell expansion, and drive immunosuppressive macrophage polarization. Moreover, lipid metabolites serve as critical signaling molecules that regulate immune checkpoints and inflammatory pathways, creating a metabolic-immunologic axis that governs tumor-immune interactions.

In melanoma, the interplay between lipid metabolism and immune regulation remains incompletely characterized. While isolated studies have implicated specific lipogenic enzymes in melanoma progression, a comprehensive analysis integrating lipid metabolic signatures with immune contexture and clinical outcomes has not been systematically performed. Such an integrated approach could reveal novel therapeutic vulnerabilities and inform combination strategies targeting both metabolic and immune pathways.

In this study, we leveraged transcriptomic and clinical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) melanoma cohort to investigate the prognostic and immunological implications of tumor lipid metabolism. We constructed a lipid metabolism signature based on key lipogenic genes and examined its associations with patient survival, immune cell infiltration patterns, and pathway enrichment profiles. Our findings reveal that elevated lipid metabolism defines a clinically and immunologically distinct melanoma subtype characterized by poor prognosis and an immunosuppressive microenvironment, highlighting potential opportunities for metabolic-immune combination therapies.
