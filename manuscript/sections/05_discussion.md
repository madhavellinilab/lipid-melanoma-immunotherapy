# Discussion

This study provides comprehensive evidence that elevated tumor lipid metabolism defines a distinct melanoma subtype characterized by poor prognosis and an immunosuppressive microenvironment. By integrating transcriptomic profiling, survival analysis, and immune deconvolution in a large melanoma cohort, we demonstrate that a lipid metabolism signature comprising key lipogenic enzymes serves as an independent prognostic biomarker and correlates with profound alterations in tumor immune contexture. These findings establish a metabolic-immunologic framework for understanding melanoma heterogeneity and suggest novel therapeutic strategies targeting the intersection of lipid metabolism and immune evasion.

## Lipid Metabolism as a Prognostic Biomarker in Melanoma

Our analysis identified that high lipid metabolism, characterized by coordinated upregulation of FASN, ACACA, SCD, ELOVL6, FADS1, FADS2, ACLY, and SREBF1, significantly correlates with reduced overall survival in melanoma patients. This observation extends previous findings in other cancer types and underscores the universal importance of lipogenic reprogramming in tumor progression. The independent prognostic value of the lipid signature, even after adjusting for established clinical variables including age and stage, suggests that metabolic phenotyping could complement traditional staging systems to improve risk stratification.

The hazard ratio of 1.72 for high versus low lipid metabolism groups represents a clinically meaningful prognostic distinction. Notably, FASN and ACACA emerged as particularly strong individual prognostic markers, consistent with their central roles in de novo fatty acid synthesis. These enzymes catalyze rate-limiting steps in lipogenesis and are frequently overexpressed across diverse malignancies. The coordinated expression of multiple lipogenic genes in high-risk tumors suggests transcriptional co-regulation, likely mediated by master regulators such as SREBP1, which itself was elevated in poor-prognosis tumors.

## Immunosuppressive Phenotype of Lipid-High Melanomas

A central finding of our study is the profound immunological reprogramming associated with elevated tumor lipid metabolism. High lipid metabolism tumors exhibited significant depletion of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes and M1 macrophages, coupled with enrichment of regulatory T cells and M2-polarized macrophages. This immune profile is characteristic of an immunosuppressive microenvironment that promotes tumor immune escape and therapeutic resistance.

The mechanistic basis for lipid metabolism-driven immunosuppression likely involves multiple intersecting pathways. First, lipid accumulation in tumor cells and the microenvironment can directly impair T cell function through lipotoxicity and metabolic competition. CD8+ T cells require robust fatty acid oxidation for effector function and memory formation, and lipid-rich environments may starve these cells of metabolic substrates. Second, lipid mediators such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes, derived from arachidonic acid metabolism, can promote immunosuppressive signaling through their cognate receptors on immune cells.

Third, lipogenic tumors may actively recruit and polarize macrophages toward M2 phenotypes through secretion of lipid-derived chemokines and cytokines. M2 macrophages not only fail to support anti-tumor immunity but actively suppress T cell responses through production of IL-10, TGF-β, and arginase. The concurrent elevation of regulatory T cells further amplifies immunosuppression, creating a multi-layered barrier to effective immune surveillance.

## Pathway-Level Insights and Therapeutic Implications

Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that lipid-high tumors exhibit coordinated upregulation of fatty acid biosynthesis, cholesterol homeostasis, and SREBP signaling pathways, alongside depletion of interferon-gamma and inflammatory response signatures. This pathway-level view reinforces the concept that metabolic and immune programs are interconnected rather than independent features of tumor biology.

The depletion of interferon-gamma signatures is particularly notable, as this cytokine is essential for anti-tumor immunity and serves as a key biomarker for immunotherapy response. Interferon-gamma drives expression of MHC molecules, antigen processing machinery, and chemokines that recruit cytotoxic lymphocytes. The inverse relationship between lipid metabolism and interferon signaling suggests that metabolic interventions could potentially restore immune responsiveness.

From a therapeutic perspective, these findings suggest several promising strategies. First, pharmacological inhibition of key lipogenic enzymes such as FASN and ACACA could simultaneously disrupt tumor cell metabolism and alleviate immunosuppression. Several FASN inhibitors have entered clinical development, and their combination with immune checkpoint blockade represents a rational approach to overcoming immunotherapy resistance. Second, targeting downstream lipid mediators or their receptors could selectively neutralize immunosuppressive signals without broadly disrupting cellular lipid homeostasis.

Third, dietary interventions that modulate systemic lipid availability may complement pharmacological approaches. Ketogenic diets and caloric restriction can alter tumor metabolism and have shown promise in preclinical cancer models. Whether such interventions can remodel the tumor immune microenvironment warrants investigation in clinical trials.

## Limitations and Future Directions

Several limitations of this study merit consideration. First, our analysis relies on bulk tumor RNA-seq data, which cannot resolve cell-type-specific contributions to the observed lipid metabolism signature. Single-cell RNA sequencing would enable precise attribution of lipogenic programs to tumor cells, immune cells, or stromal components. Second, the correlative nature of transcriptomic analysis precludes definitive causal inferences. Functional validation using genetic or pharmacological perturbation of lipid metabolism in preclinical models is needed to establish mechanistic relationships.

Third, the TCGA cohort lacks detailed treatment information, limiting our ability to assess whether lipid metabolism influences response to specific therapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors or BRAF/MEK inhibitors. Prospective studies incorporating metabolic biomarkers into clinical trial designs would address this gap. Fourth, metabolomic and lipidomic profiling would provide direct measurements of lipid species and metabolic flux, complementing transcriptomic inference of metabolic activity.

Future studies should integrate multi-omic approaches to comprehensively characterize the metabolic-immune axis in melanoma. Spatial transcriptomics and multiplexed imaging could reveal the spatial organization of lipid-high tumor regions and their relationship to immune infiltration patterns. Finally, clinical trials testing metabolic inhibitors in combination with immunotherapy will be essential to translate these findings into improved patient outcomes.

## Conclusions

This study establishes elevated tumor lipid metabolism as a defining feature of an aggressive melanoma subtype with poor prognosis and immunosuppressive microenvironment. The integration of lipid metabolic signatures with immune profiling reveals a metabolic-immunologic axis that governs melanoma biology and therapeutic vulnerability. Targeting lipid metabolism represents a promising strategy to enhance anti-tumor immunity and overcome therapeutic resistance in melanoma patients. These findings provide a framework for developing biomarker-driven clinical trials that combine metabolic inhibitors with immunotherapy to improve outcomes in this challenging disease.
