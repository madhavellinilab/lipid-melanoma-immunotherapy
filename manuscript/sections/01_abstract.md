# Abstract

## Background
Melanoma remains a significant clinical challenge despite advances in immunotherapy. Emerging evidence suggests that tumor lipid metabolism influences immune evasion and therapeutic resistance, yet the relationship between lipid metabolic programs and immune contexture in melanoma is poorly understood.

## Methods
We analyzed RNA-seq data from 472 melanoma patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA-SKCM) cohort. A lipid metabolism signature was constructed using eight key lipogenic genes (FASN, ACACA, SCD, ELOVL6, FADS1, FADS2, ACLY, SREBF1). Patients were stratified into high and low lipid metabolism groups. We performed survival analysis, immune cell deconvolution using CIBERSORTx, and gene set enrichment analysis to characterize the prognostic and immunological implications of tumor lipid metabolism.

## Results
High lipid metabolism was significantly associated with reduced overall survival (p = 0.0095, log-rank test; HR = 1.68, 95% CI: 1.13-2.49). Multivariate analysis confirmed lipid signature as an independent prognostic factor (HR = 1.72, p = 0.008) after adjusting for clinical covariates. High lipid metabolism tumors exhibited an immunosuppressive microenvironment characterized by reduced CD8+ T cell infiltration (p < 0.01), decreased M1 macrophages (p < 0.05), elevated regulatory T cells (p < 0.01), and increased M2 macrophage polarization (p < 0.05). Gene set enrichment analysis revealed significant upregulation of fatty acid biosynthesis and cholesterol homeostasis pathways, alongside depletion of interferon-gamma and inflammatory response signatures in high lipid metabolism tumors.

## Conclusions
Elevated tumor lipid metabolism defines a distinct melanoma subtype with poor prognosis and an immunosuppressive microenvironment. These findings suggest that targeting lipid metabolic pathways may represent a novel therapeutic strategy to enhance anti-tumor immunity and improve outcomes in melanoma patients. The integration of lipid metabolism biomarkers with immune profiling could inform personalized treatment strategies and patient stratification in future clinical trials.
